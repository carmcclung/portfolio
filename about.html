		<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Hi, I’m Carrie. I am, of course, a technical writer, but I’m also a lifelong learner, 
				an adept communicator, and someone with natural curiosity who has a serious passion for 
				content creation, architecture, structure, storage, and display. I’m equally passionate 
				about making content readable, accessible, and inherently intuitive. To me, there is nothing 
				worse than a beautiful user interface—be it mechanical or electronic—that people have no 
				idea how to interact with.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I had to describe myself, I would say that I love figuring out what makes things tick. 
				In part, it’s my intense need-to-know that lead me to technical writing. I started my career 
				working in administrative support roles and it was there that I learned that there is such a 
				thing as “technical writing.” It reminded me of the reports and documents I prepared for college 
				chemistry courses. It piqued my interest so much that eventually I sought out a university program 
				in technical communications, which gave me a useful base of knowledge that I could apply in my work.
			</p>
			<p>
				About 15 years ago when I was finishing my technical communications degree, I began working 
				for a medical device company where I’ve worked on everything from application software to 
				complex medical devices. I’ve worked with mechanical engineers, software engineers, regulatory 
				affairs, design quality, clinical affairs, marketing, and so many other skilled subject matter 
				experts during this period. I’ve been part of regulatory submissions, such as 510(k), and produced
				a large volume of documentation. I’ve partnered with UX/UI to help write the text that appears 
				onscreen for both standalone application software and embedded software. I've worked with
				localization experts and translators to answer questions about products and to explain complex
				concepts.
