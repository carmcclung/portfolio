	<h2>Career Highlights</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Successfully managed the integration and revamp of user facing content for multiple products during an acquisition.
		</li>
			<ul><li>This project involved converting 41 total pieces of documentation from Microsoft Word to DITA XML. The content 
				included 26 instructions for use (IFUs) and two manuals and was migrated into a CMS to facilitate significant 
				content reuse across the products. During this process I supervised a contract writer who was hired to support
				the project, I collaborated with multiple stakeholders and SMEs across the organization, and I led the effort
				to incorporate the product facing documentation into the companies' processes.
				</li>
			</ul>			
		<li>Created a process for managing UI text development for an enterprise software project that spanned eleven distributed teams.
		</li>
		<li>Oversaw and produced the labeling and user documentation for several successful regulatory submission processes, such as 510(k).
		</li>
		<li>Developed suites of user facing documentation for state-of-the-art medical devices and a cloud-based software application.
		</li>
		<li>Contributed significantly to solutions for content reuse and translation issues in a CMS.
		<li>Wrote, edited, and maintained thousands of lines of text that appear on user interfaces for both devices with embedded software 
			and standalone software applications.
		</li> 
<!-- 			<p>
				The main issue the company faced was shared content being pulled into translation when it didn't need to be retranslated.
				I helped identify a solution that allowed us to store the content in a more granular way. This helped minimze the number
				of topics that were included in each translation package. Previously the content was being stored in large, unwieldy shell
				topics.
